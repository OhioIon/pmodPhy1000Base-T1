# pmodPhy1000Base-T1
 Pmod™ Compatible Automotive Ethernet PHY 100/1000BASE-T1

Extends host controller boards supporting Digilent Pmod™ Compatible headers with a single 100BASE-T1 or 1000BASE-T1 automotive/industrial Gigabit Ethernet PHY. A single pair Unshielded-Twisted-Pair (UTP) cable can be used to make a 15 m long point-to-point connection between two devices.

Features:
- 100/1000BASE-T1 Ethernet PHY
- Complies with the "Digilent Pmod™ Interface Specification
- SGMII host interface
- MDIO access to PHY registers
- Main/Secondary selection via DIP switch

Requirements:
- Gigabit Ethernet MAC on host controller board (for example in FPGA logic)
- SGMII capable I/O resources (1.25 Gbps, LVDS, 8b/10b encoding, 625 MHz clock, DDR for TX and RX data)
